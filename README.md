**Counterexamples for fun & education.** 

This repo curates intentionally awful code samples (“exhibits”) across languages to help developers spot anti-patterns, sniff out smells, and practise refactoring. It’s a **teaching museum**, not a wall of shame.

> ⚠️ **Safety first:** Exhibits are insecure, leaky, brittle, and misleading **by design**.  
> Do **not** run them in production, against real services, or anywhere you care about.

## Why this exists 🤔

- **Learn by contrast.** 👀 Seeing *what not to do* sharpens code review instincts and improves architectural taste.
- **Have some fun.** 😂 A little gallows humour about software disasters keeps things memorable.
- **Shareable teaching aids.** 🎓 Drop an exhibit into a brown-bag session or code kata and refactor together.

This project’s name is a playful nod to UNSW’s **Museum of Human Disease**—a long-running educational collection in Sydney. We’re **not affiliated** with UNSW or the museum. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

- Each exhibit includes:

  - the **bad code** (as-is, unformatted),
  - a short **“What’s wrong here?”** checklist,
  - optionally a **safer rewrite** for contrast.

## Current Exhibits 🏛️

- **🐍 Python ex-001**: Global chaos, eval() dangers, SQL injection
- **🐍 Python ex-002**: Parentheses ceremony (formatting terrorism)  
- **☕ Java ex-001**: Bracket alignment terrorism (Python-style), resource leaks, SQL injection
- **🦀 Rust ex-001**: Borrow checker destruction, unsafe code paradise, memory leaks
- **🎭 JavaScript ex-001**: Type coercion hell, prototype pollution, callback pyramid
- **🔧 FreePascal ex-001**: Memory leaks, race conditions, goto abuse
- **🗄️ SQL ex-001**: Absolute NATURAL JOIN chaos, injection vulnerabilities

## Contributing 🤝

PRs welcome! Please follow the vibe:

1. **Keep it educational.** 🎓 No calling out individuals or companies. No doxxing.
2. **Isolate danger.** 🔒 Don't include secrets, real endpoints, or irreversible commands.
3. **Explain the harm.** 💡 Add a checklist that teaches *why* the code is bad.
4. **Small, focused exhibits.** 🎯 One main theme per exhibit (it's okay to sprinkle minor sins).
5. **Naming:** 📝 `ex-XYZ-short-slug.ext` with a matching notes file.

Before merging, we’ll sanity-check that an exhibit:

* runs (or *fails*) in a controlled way,
* doesn’t reach out to real services unless mocked,
* doesn’t include malware or anything illegal.

---

## Usage (for workshops) 🎪

* **Show the specimen.** 😱 Let people cringe for 2–3 minutes.
* **Ask for smells.** 👃 Collect observations before revealing the checklist.
* **Time-boxed refactor.** ⏰ 15–20 minutes, pairs or groups.
* **Debrief.** 🗣️ Compare approaches and tradeoffs.

## Code of Conduct 💖

- Be kind. 🤗 We're here to learn.
- This repo exists **for fun and education** 🎉—it's **not** about shaming anyone's past code. Most of us have written versions of these exhibits! 😅

## Inspiration 💡

* **Museum of Human Disease (UNSW, founded 1959)** 🏥—an educational collection helping people understand health and disease. Again, **no affiliation**; we just love the museum metaphor. 🏛️ ([UNSW Museum of Human Disease][1])
